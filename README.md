# Landing Page - Tom's Jazz School

This project consists of building a landing page for a fictional music school called Tom's Jazz School. To develop the project, HTML and CSS were used, as well as responsive design techniques. 

The project was developed following the Mobile First principle, and adjustments were later made for desktop viewing.


## Learnings

- Use of classes and pseudoclasses in styling a landing page.
